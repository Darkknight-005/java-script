there are two kinds of operators bitwise logical and bitwise shift operstors 

Operator 	                        Usage 	            Description
Bitwise AND 	                    a & b 	            Returns a one in each bit position for which the 
                                                        corresponding bits of both operands are ones.

Bitwise OR 	                        a | b               Returns a zero in each bit position for which the 
                                                        corresponding bits of both operands are zeros.

Bitwise XOR 	                    a ^ b 	            Returns a zero in each bit position for which the   
                                                        corresponding bits are the same. [Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits are different.]

Bitwise NOT 	                    ~ a 	            Inverts the bits of its operand.

Left shift 	                        a << b 	            Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the left, 
                                                        shifting in zeros from the right.

Sign-propagating right shift 	    a >> b 	            Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the right,
                                                        discarding bits shifted off.

Zero-fill right shift 	            a >>> b 	        Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the right,
                                                        discarding bits shifted off, and shifting in zeros from the left.*/
/*bitwise opertor use bite for logical test
like 00000000,00000001,00000010 etc.

if we write code the bitwise operators convert them in bit and then decide logic for true or false the execute it right now i don't have example how to explain.*/
